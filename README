this is a work in progress and will probably never go anywhere.

small bash-based MUD. to "install":

1)useradd -m -s/bin/mud muduser
2) mv mud /bin/mud && chmod +x /bin/mud
3) mkdir /home/muduser/players /home/muduser/world && chown -R muduser:muduser /home/muduser

and that's about it. connect with ssh as 'muduser' and awaaaay you go.
